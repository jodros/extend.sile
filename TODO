# TODO

## MINOR

## CURRENT

- imposition automation - e.g. it could be passed through the settings.toml and run with os.execute()
- document all new packages, flex class and core functions!!!!!!!
- indexing from list of names, get each page where it appears...
- ready-made set of framesets, thus it doesn't take so much space in the toml specification, so just frames.right = "half", for the current default frameset instead of the whole instruction "100%ph-(...))
- finish \front and \toc basic styling
- settings.toml have instead the same name as the .sil, like ordem.sil ordem.toml if there is only one .sil file, letting settings.toml for larger projects
