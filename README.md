# extend.sile

A bunch of changes and new packages for the SILE typesetting system I've making for personal use.

All details are still to be written in the documentation...

## Requirements

I can't say whether it works with older versions of SILE since I'm always using the latest one and won't waste my time testing it.  

LuaRocks will automatically install the dependencies if you don't have them yet:

- [lua-toml](https://github.com/jonstoler/lua-toml)
- [LuaFileSystem](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luafilesystem)
- [datafile](https://github.com/hishamhm/datafile) 

<!-- Fonts: -->
<!-- - Symbola  is a good option for characters like ▩▤▧⌘... -->
